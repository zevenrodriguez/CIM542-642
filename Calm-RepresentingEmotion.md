# Calm - Representing emotion

The goal of this project is to represent the **calm** emotion. I created a paper sculpture in the shape of a cylinder with a wave pattern cut into it. I then used Duralar paper to diffuse my light pattern.

## Sculpture

The paper sculpture was built using this [Template Maker](https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/) site and illustrator. I used the Cricuit Maker to cut the shapes out.

I decided to use a fading pattern to emit a calming sensations.

## Issues
* The bristol paper I used was too stiff which made it an issue making into a cylinder.
* I should have used a glue stick instead of hot glue to make the seems closer.
