### [Assignment Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aRW-1WVop2TL-hg-7DSC5-Elbw6UCwiXGn3wyxXZGxI/edit?usp=sharing)

* Create a documentation page for Representing Emotion Project
  * Include a title with your Emotion, introduction to the project. Why you chose your pattern.
  * Document/record your project

### Making
* Create a Sculpture or Design that expresses your emotion
* Must use Paper or Sheet Material
* Must have one aspect made with the vinyl cutter

### Electronics
* Minimum 3 LEDs
  * Must be soldered
* Minimum one Switch
* LEDs must be programmed/animated to represent your emotion
* Your program will have 3 modes
  * On-Emotion-Off

## Project 2: Playful Interfaces

The goal of this project is to create a fun analog interface. Think of a toy, gag, carnival games, musical instruments, etc. Try finding items around that house to help you build your projects. As you are building your project, think about a component you would need to 3D print. Using the tools you have, design your part on Onshape.
